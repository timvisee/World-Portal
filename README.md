### Project abandoned, hotfixes available
This project has been abandoned since 2012.
Because of this, no new features will be added to the plugin.

There are still quite a lot of servers using the plugin.
I'm happy to release a hotfix is required if the plugin breaks on the newest Minecraft version available.

If a hotfix is desired, be sure to contact me, preferrably through [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/members/timvisee).
